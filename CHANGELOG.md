    - Added **SoftReset** method to the Driver class  
    - Added the **ccSpecific** property to the **ValueMetadata** class
    - Added the ability to add new server methods to the library during runtime.

    - ZWave JS Server Version: 1.14.0 (Schema Version 14)

  - New Features
    - Added **RemoveFailedNode** method
    - Added **ReplaceFailedNode** method
    - Added **inclusion aborted** event handler
    - Added ability to override the schema on which to connect to a zwave-js-server instance.  
      This allows backwards compatibility with older server versions.

    - Webclient instance is now correctly disposed, after downloading the PSI.
    - Fixed platform detection logic
    - Fixed throwing exception on server process exit.

- v1.0.0

  - Versions
    - ZWave JS Driver Version: 8.9.1
    - ZWave JS Server Version: 1.14.0 (Schema Version 14)

  - Breaking Changes
    - **endpoints** object is no longer accessible on the **ZWaveNode** class, instead, they are acessed via  
      **ZWaveNode.GetEndpoint(int Index)**
    - **InvokeCCAPI** no longer accepts an **endpoint**, instead **InvokeCCAPI** is now called on the **ZWaveNode** class itself,  
      or an instance of **Endpoint** as obtained by **ZWaveNode.GetEndpoint(int Index)**

      These 2 changes now mirror the zwave-js API with regards to endpoint access.

      Examples:

      ```c#
      Driver.Controller.Nodes.Get(4).InvokeCCAPI(int CommandClass, string Method, params object[] Params)
      Driver.Controller.Nodes.Get(4).GetEndpoint(2).InvokeCCAPI(int CommandClass, string Method, params object[] Params)
      ```
